# sbti

sbt, but like npm, because npm-style is simply better :trollface:

# setup



# help

```bash
Usage: sbti <command>

```

[Interactive example](http://showterm.io/a84c337eaa9c560b730f2)

### Goals

- auto-resolve (use a central repository?)
- search names in repositories. e.g. If the user ask to install amqp-client, sbti should asks if he meant com.rabbitmq/amqp-client@X.X.X and other equivalents

### Todo

- if `--save or -S were not specified, directly install the library inside lib/ folder
- everything else...
